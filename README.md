Deep Learning-Based Glaucoma Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks on Retinal images.

The primary aim of this project is to develop an ML-based system for the automatic detection of glaucoma from fundus images. The system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce the time required for image analysis, and provide consistent results, thereby facilitating early detection and treatment of Glaucoma to prevent vision loss.
